Welcome to my personal portfolio — a space where music and technology converge.

I’m Byungjin Kim, a composer and sound artist with over two decades of experience in music creation, performance, and education. Alongside my artistic work, I am also a trained software developer and aspiring product thinker, passionate about designing interactive tools and experiences that amplify human creativity.
