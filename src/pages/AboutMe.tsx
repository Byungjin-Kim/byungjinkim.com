            <p>
                Byungjin Kim hails from Seoul, South Korea, and has pursued his musical 
                and technological journey across continents. After earning degrees from 
                Hanyang University in Seoul and The New School in New York City, he 
                completed his Doctor of Musical Arts in composition at the University of 
                Illinois Urbana-Champaign. His compositions span contemporary classical, 
                electroacoustic, and interactive media, with performances in South Korea, 
                Germany, Austria, and the United States.

                Alongside his career as a composer, Byungjin is a software developer 
                specializing in full-stack web applications, with a focus on music-related 
                projects that merge creativity and technology. His projects range from 
                educational music apps for children to collaborative tools for musicians 
                and researchers. Notably, he collaborated with the New York Philharmonic 
                to arrange selections from *West Side Story* for their Central Park concert.

            <p>
                Byungjinâ€™s work is driven by the belief that music and technology together 
                can expand the boundaries of artistic expression and create inclusive, 
                engaging experiences for audiences worldwide.
