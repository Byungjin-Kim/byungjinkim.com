                Byungjin Kim is a composer, conductor, organist, pianist, sound artist 
                and software engineer whose work lies at the intersection of music, technology, 
                and cultural hybridity.

                His compositions—both acoustic and electroacoustic—blend traditional forms with 
                contemporary sound design, drawing on regional, historical, and cultural elements 
                to create immersive, interdisciplinary musical experiences.
            </p>

                Alongside his musical career, Kim is an experienced software engineer and full-stack 
                web developer, having trained in modern front-end and back-end technologies 
                (React, Node.js, Express, SQL, TypeScript, and more). His development work includes 
                interactive, accessibility-focused music education tools and real-time data visualization 
                projects, bridging artistic creativity with user-centered digital design.
